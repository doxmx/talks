## Talk proposal 
#### Tensorflow and kubernetes

Just want to share with the team, what I'm recently playing on, (just for fun) in terms of tensorflow, not being a Data Scientiest 
but on the Ops/SRE perspective with kubernetes and image recognition with the Golang client, this will also allow me to practice as I'm 
thinking to participate giving a similar talk in a San Antonio kubernetes meetup.


I'll be documenting/uploading slides here if the talk is approved, targeting 11/7 or 11/9
